MissingOutputException in line 12 of /Users/neha/Horizon/Horizon_Project/Heart_Disease/Snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
output_cv/cross_validation.csv
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
